                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    
                    <p>Penguin-Safari is a company that dates back to the early 19th century. The year was 1814 when our
                    founder, Lord Reginald Holsterford had just come back from a trip to the Southern Hemisphere. On his journey
                    across Antarctica he came in contact with a vast number of penguins which he found most fascinating.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although to his horror, the poor creatures he encountered were half starved and Lord Holsterford decided to help
                    nurture the penguins back to health. The colony of penguins developed such a strong emotional bond to their
                    saviour that when Lord Holsterford was about to leave, the penguins followed him all the way to his ship.</p>
                    
                    <p>Holsterford thought about what to do for quite a while, and then came up with a solution. He too had become
                    quite fond of the penguins and took them on his ship back to civilization. When he arrived back at home he
                    spent a fortune on building a park for the penguins, with a genuine cold climate, ice, snow and a whole lot of
                    water so that they would feel safe and comfortable.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today we are pround to say that many of the penguins at our park are descendants in a straight line
                    from the ones that Lord Reginald Holsterford saved from Antarctica! Nowdays we also have more than one kind
                    of penguins! We even keep warm pools of water for our species from the Galapagos islands!</p>

                    <h3>Facts About Penguins</h3>
                    
                    <p>Penguins are gentle and friendly creatures of the non-flying part of the avian family.They usually live in
                    large colonies, since that helps prevent against predators.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are two main locations for penguins, aside from zoos which are Antarctica and the Galapagos Islands.
                    This goes to prove that penguins can adapt well to climate changes since those two places are opposites of each
                    other, one being a frozen hellish wasteland and the other being a tropical paradise of pleasantness.</p>
                    
                    <p>Penguins are very fashionable creatures, wearing a feather coat of black and white. They majestically waddle
                    around, play or sunbathe as much as possible, so long as they arn't hungry! A penguins diet usually consists of
                    fish, any size it can possibly swallow will do for these tuxedocoated little rascals!</p>
                    
                    <p>When it is time to reproduce, the penguin mother lays one or two eggs. During the incubation period, the mates
                    take shifts to go feed, leaving the other mate behind to guard and keep the eggs warm. These shifts can last
                    for weeks since the climate the penguins usually live in is harsh and cold and the food sources sparse.</p>
